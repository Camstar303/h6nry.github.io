Should be compatible with iOS 6.0 - 9.x<br><br>
Requested from /u/habib_hbo on reddit. It, well, counts your taps. Quite interesting. Might not be very precise nor very performant (although I took 5 minutes to implement and 30 minutes to optimize).<br>
Might not work on anything else than iOS 6 but it is up to yu to try it. I only used "official" APIs, which are still there in iOS 9.</div>
