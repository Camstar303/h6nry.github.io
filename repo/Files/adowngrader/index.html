Requires iOS 6 (maybe compatible below)<br><br>
A very basic app downgrade tool implementation. I wrote this because I could not wait for unlimapps to update their App Admin tool for iOS 6 (which might never happen, anyways...). As I said, just the very basics: Downgrade an app if you have a workig "external version identifier". Not hiding updates, no fancy UI, complicated interface.<br><br>
<b>How to use</b><br>
1) Find out the "external version identifier" of the version of the app you want to downgrade.<br>
2) Go to settings -> Adowngrader, enter your "external version identifier" into the field "Version-ID".<br>
3) Enable Adowngrader by toggling "Downgrade mode" on.<br>
4) Download your app as usually.<br>
5) Important: *Wait* for it to finish!<br>
6) Important: Go to settings -> Adowngrader, disable Adowngrader by toggling "Downgrade mode" off!<br>
7) Start your app :)<br><br>
<b>Spelling</b><br>
"A" like the french "un" (one/a) and "downgrader" like the english word "downgrade" with an appended "-er", like in "murderer". Short "A" and stress the "do", then "wngrader" spoken out slowly. I have no clue why I spent one thought on this.
